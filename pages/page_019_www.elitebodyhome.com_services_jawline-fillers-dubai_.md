## How Does Jawline Filler Work
Jawline filler utilizes dermal fillers, which usually contain hyaluronic acid or other biocompatible materials, to augment the contour and definition of the jawline. Filler is injected strategically along the jawline to provide volume, sculpt the shape, and achieve a more contoured effect. It can correct asymmetry, minimize jowls and give a more sharp, youthful appearance. Results are seen almost immediately, have little to no downtime, and last anywhere from 6 to 18 months, depending on what type of filler you get.
