## What is Diabetes Management?
Diabetes management is the continuous process of blood glucose level control, of maintaining a good overall state of health and of preventing or minimizing complications of diabetes. Management is based on lifestyle changes, medications to control blood sugar levels, and regular measurement of your blood glucose. It enables individuals with diabetes to live healthier, longer and more fulfilling lives by helping lower risks for heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage and vision problems.
## Procedure of Glucose Management
Diagnosis and management of diabetes involve several components depending on the type of diabetes (specifically whether the patient has Type 1, Type 2, or gestational diabetes). It's a multifaceted approach that includes:
##### Initial Assessment
Blood tests (such as the A1C test or fasting glucose) to measure blood sugar levels, assessment of patient history and lifestyle factors, and thorough medical examination.
##### Personalized Care Plan
Dietitian will work with you to plan meals and offer nutrition advice. Prescribing medication (insulin injections for Type 1 or oral medication for Type 2).
##### Self-Monitoring
Frequent self-testing with glucometer or continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Maintaining a log of daily blood sugars to identify trends.
##### Lifestyle Changes
Establishing a consistent exercise regime. Eating a balanced diet with whole grains, fruits, vegetables and lean protein. Cutting back on sugar and refined carbohydrates.
##### Medication Therapy
Type 1 diabetes requires insulin therapy (injections or pump). Type 2 may need oral medications or insulin to control blood sugar levels.
##### Regular Checkups
Regular visits to manage blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure. Yearly eye exams, kidney function tests and foot care.
## Benefits of Diabetes Management

## Preparation for Diabetes Management

##### Understand Your Diagnosis
Learn about your diabetes type, symptoms and potential complications.
##### Blood Sugar Tracking
Begin tracking with either a glucometer or continuous glucose monitor (CGM).
##### Healthcare Team
