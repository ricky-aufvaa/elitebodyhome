## Steps For Dental Crown Procedure
Getting a dental crown usually takes two visits, with a few steps involved. The objective is to condition the impacted tooth and place a crown that visually and functionally resembles your other natural teeth.
##### Consultation
Your dentist will examine the affected tooth with X-rays or other diagnostic tools to decide whether a crown is the best treatment option.
##### Tooth Preparation
The tooth is formed to receive the crown. This could include a removal of some of the outer wall of the tooth.
##### Impressions
Your dentist makes impressions of the prepared tooth and sends them to a dental lab to create a custom crown.
##### Temporary Crown
A temporary crown is placed to cover up the hole while waiting for your permanent crown to be made.
## Benefits
Like many dental procedures dental crowns provide a variety of benefits and are among the most frequently recommended restorative treatments in dentistry.
##### Protection
They shield weak or damaged teeth from further decay, fractures, or breakage.
##### Durability
Crowns are constructed from durable materials such as porcelain, ceramic, or metal, making them long-lasting solution.
##### Aesthetic Improvement
Crowns can be designed to mimic the coloration and shape of your natural teeth, making your smile look its best.
##### Restored Function
Crowns return the ability to chew and speak comfortably if tooth damage affected those functions.
## Eligibility
Not all dental conditions call for a crown, but they are perfect when a tooth is significantly compromised or weakened. People that qualify for dental crowns usually have:
##### Very Decayed or Damaged Teeth
Crowns are typically recommended when fillings or other restorative options are insufficient.
##### Root Canal-Treated Teeth
After this procedure, the tooth can lose strength and become brittle, which is why a crown is needed for protection.
##### Cracked or Broken Teeth
Crowns protect the tooth from more damage by covering the entire tooth structure.
##### Worn-Down Teeth
But crowns can protect teeth that have become worn down from grinding or erosion from acid.
## Preparation
There are several steps with dental crowning therapy, before receiving a crowning therapy. Having the right approach ahead of time will help not just to make the procedure work but also to promote long-lasting results.
##### Consultation with your dentist
Talk about your symptoms, goals and medical history.
##### X-Rays & Imaging
Your dentist will probably take X-rays to evaluate the tooth and surrounding bone structure.
##### Dental Hygiene
Practice good oral hygiene leading up to the procedure to help prevent your risk of infection or complications.
##### Understanding the procedure
Your dentist will go over the procedure for you, as well as what you can expect, the timeline, and aftercare instructions.
##### Temporary Crown Care
If they put in a temporary crown, then avoid sticky foods and brush soft to protect the temporary — it will come out if you eat the wrong things.
## Results
However, dental crowns give instant functional and aesthetic advantages. Once the crown is cemented in place, you'll find that this is an improvement over the previous tooth in terms of strength, aesthetics, and function.
##### Improved Chewing & Speaking
They restore the normal function of the tooth so that you can chew and speak without pain.
##### Enhanced Smile
Crowns enhance damaged or stained teeth, resulting in a more beautiful smile.
##### Long-term Protection
With proper care, veneers have an average lifespan of about 15 years, during which they continue to look and feel very strong and natural.
##### Increased Confidence
Dental crowns increase your confidence in everyday activities as well as your smile by restoring the strength, appearance, and function of your teeth.
