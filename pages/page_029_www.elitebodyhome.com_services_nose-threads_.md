# Nose Threads
## Enhance Your Profile with Nose Threads
Nose threads, or thread lift for the nose is a minimally invasive, cosmetic procedure ideal for those looking to improve the shape and contour of the nose.

## Procedure
Nose thread procedure is a non-surgical approach where biocompatible threads such as polydioxanone (PDO) threads are used in order to achieve lifting, shaping and contouring of the nose. Restructuring threads are laced under the skin to give our structure and support especially around the nasal bridge and tip.
##### Consultation
A comprehensive consultation is conducted to determine a patient's goals and whether they are a good candidate for the treatment.
##### Anesthesia
A topical anesthetic is given, so that the procedure is pain-free.
##### Thread Insertion
PDO threads are strategically placed underneath the skin of the nose using a fine needle, focusing on specific areas for the required lift and contouring. The threads dissolve gradually & over time, promote collagen formation as well as coveted internal scaffolding.
##### Shaping
Once in place, the threads are adjusted (stretched simply or extracted gently) to form the appealing contour: defined bridge, upturning tip, narrowed silhouette, and so forth.
## Benefits
Read on to find out how nose threads can help improve your aesthetic appeal if you're looking for non-surgical treatment for the nose. It handles general cosmetic issues like flat or low nasal bridge, bulbous tip or slight asymmetry.
##### Non-surgical
No incision, less pain, and less downtime than traditional rhinoplasty.
##### Immediate Results
Noticeable differences in the shape and contour of the nose can be observed immediately after the surgery.
##### Collagen Stimulation
PDO threads also promote collagen, improving the nose's structure and firmness overall.
##### Customizable
The procedure can be customized for the patient's unique facial structure and goals.
##### Natural-Looking Results
These threads create natural-looking improvements that highlight your best features.
## Eligibility
Nose threads are a great alternative for anyone wanting to have slight changes in nose shape and structure. Although the treatment is generally safe and effective, it may not be appropriate for everyone.
##### Persons with low or flat nasal bridge
Nose threads are particularly popular in certain ethnicities, as they can be used to elevate and project the nasal bridge.
##### People visiting for small changes
The procedure is most suitable to individuals who want subtle improvements rather than drastic alterations.
##### People who do not want to undergo surgery
If you want to improve the appearance of the nose without the downtime and risks associated with rhinoplasty, nose threads are a great alternative.
##### Expecting realistic things from people
It's important to have a realistic expectation of the kind of results that can be the end product of non-surgical options.
## Preparation
A nose thread procedure can give the desired results, but only if you prepare yourself beforehand to avoid any complications.
##### Consultation & assessment
In the first consultation, discuss the aesthetic goals, medical history and discuss any possible concerns with the practitioner.
##### Avoid blood thinners
Avoid blood-thinning medications, supplements or substances (including aspirin, ibuprofen and alcohol) for at least a week before the procedure to minimize the risk of bruising.
##### No makeup
Please come with face washed clear from make up's & lotions over the nose area on your treatment day.
##### Skin care
Adhere to any instructions that your practitioner gives you to help care for your skin in the days following the procedure, like using gentle cleansers and avoiding difficult exfoliants.
## Results
The effects of a nose thread are immediate and long-lasting.
##### Increased definition of the nasal bridge
Aesthetics of the nasal bridge are improved, both in height and structure, achieving a more refined appearance.
##### Lifted nasal tip
These threads lift a drooping or rounded nasal tip creating a crisper, more balanced profile.
##### Natural-looking contouring
Without appearing overdone or fake, the nose's overall shape is enhanced.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How long do nose threads last?
The effects of nose threads can last anywhere from 12 to 24 months, depending on the patient's skin type, lifestyle, and the specific PDO threads used. As the threads dissolve, collagen production continues, which helps maintain the enhanced shape over time.
### Are nose threads painful?
Most patients report minimal discomfort during the procedure, thanks to the application of a local anesthetic. Some mild soreness, swelling, or bruising may occur afterward, but these side effects usually subside within a few days.
### Can nose threads be combined with other treatments?
Yes, nose threads can be combined with other non-surgical treatments, such as dermal fillers, to further enhance the contour and structure of the nose. Consult with your practitioner to explore combination treatments that suit your goals.
### How soon can I see results?
Results from nose threads are immediate, with the full effects becoming more apparent as any initial swelling subsides over the following days. The lift and contour will continue to improve as the threads stimulate collagen production.
