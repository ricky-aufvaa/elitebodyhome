## Frequently Asked Questions
Common questions about liposuction
### Is liposuction a weight loss method?
No, liposuction is not intended for weight loss but rather for body contouring and reshaping areas that don't respond to diet or exercise.
### How long do liposuction results last?
Results in the treated areas are permanent because fat cells are completely removed. However, maintaining a stable weight and healthy lifestyle is important as remaining fat cells can still expand with weight gain.
### Can fat return after liposuction?
No, fat cells removed during liposuction don't grow back. However, you can still gain weight in other untreated areas if you don't maintain a healthy lifestyle.
### When will I see results?
Initial results may be visible after a few weeks once swelling decreases, with final results typically appearing within 3-6 months after complete healing.
### How much weight can I lose with liposuction?
The amount of weight loss varies based on individual goals, treated areas, and amount of fat removed. It's not primarily a weight loss procedure.
### What's the recovery time?
Most patients can return to light activities within a few days, with full recovery taking several weeks. Strenuous activities should be avoided for about 4-6 weeks.
