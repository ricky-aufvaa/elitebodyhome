## Fat Freezing Treatment — What You Must Know
Cryolipolysis, popularly known as fat freezing treatment, entails assisting the body with fat loss acts by externally targeting fat cells by freezing them with the help of controlled cooling in a way that does not affect the adjacent cells, which are gradually removed by the body. The process is based on the fact that fat cells are more sensitive to cold temperatures than other types of tissue, so they can be selectively eliminated without harming the skin or surrounding muscles.
## How Does Fat Freezing Work?
Fat freezing cools the targeted areas of fat to a colder temperature that causes the fat cells to crystallize and die. Here's a brief, step-by-step outline of the process:
##### Consultation
A professional will assess the treatment areas and create an individualized care plan.
##### Application of Cooling Device
An applicator is applied to the skin that delivers controlled cooling to the layer of fat beneath the skin.
##### Freezing of Fat Cells
This cooling stage lasts between 30-60 minutes and freezes the fat cells without causing any pain for the patient.
##### Natural Elimination
In the weeks that follow, the dead fat cells are gradually processed and eliminated via the body's lymphatic system.
## Advantages of Fat Freezing Therapy
##### There are many advantages of fat freezing for those looking for a non-surgical method of fat reduction
Here are some of its major benefits:
##### Non-invasive
Requires no incisions, anesthesia, or downtime.
##### Targeted Fat Reduction
Successfully treats resistant fat pockets that do not respond to diet and exercise.
##### Safe and Painless
It delivers a gentle cooling effect that does not damage surrounding tissues.
##### Quick & Long-Lasting Results
The whole process is quick (15 to 30 minutes), and the results can last 4 to 6 months!
##### Permanent Fat Loss
Because when fat cells are destroyed, they are gone from the body, permanently.

## Who is Considered a Suitable Candidate for Fat Freezing Procedure?
Fat freezing is great for those who are near their desired body weight, but have trouble spots that will not go away no matter how clean a diet you follow. The ideal patient for this treatment:
##### Near Goal Weight
Are within 10-20 pounds of their goal weight.
##### Realistic Expectations
Set realistic expectations and know that fat freezing is not a weight-loss procedure.
##### Localized Fat Deposits
If you have stubborn fat in localized area like belly, thighs, arms or back.
##### Health Conditions
Are not pregnant or nursing. Do not have cryoglobulinemia or cold agglutinin disease.
## What to Do before Fat Freezing Treatment
The better prepared you are, the better results you'll get from your fat freezing session, so keep reading. Here are a few things to do before your appointment:
##### Avoid Anti-inflammatory Medications
These can disrupt the body's inflammation response, and that's a vital part for getting rid of the fat cells.
##### Wear Loose Clothing
Try to wear loose comfortable clothing: You want to be comfortable during the procedure, and loose-fitting clothing will avoid putting pressure on the treated areas afterward.
##### Stay Hydrated
Hydrating thoroughly supports recovery and improves the ability of the lymphatic system to flush dead fat cells.
##### Avoid Tanning
Skin that is tanned or sunburned may be more sensitive in the procedure.
##### Clean Skin
The day of your treatment, arrive with a clean face, free of makeup or lotions.
## Results
The optimal results are seen over 2-3 months with a marked loss of fat volume in the treated areas. With hard work dieting and exercising, the results can last a very long time, since fat cells do not regenerate.
##### Visible Fat Reduction
Noticeable reduction in fat volume in treated areas within 2-3 months.
##### Permanent Results
Destroyed fat cells are permanently eliminated from the body.
##### Long-Term Maintenance
Results can be long-lasting with proper diet and exercise.

## Aftercare Tips
##### Fat Freezing treatment aftercare is very important to get the best results
Although the procedure is non-invasive and carries few side effects, these aftercare tips can improve both your post-op recovery and your fat reduction process:
##### Stay Hydrated
Drink plenty of water to flush out dead fat cells from your body more effectively. Keeping hydrated is also essential for your health in general and helps you recover faster.
##### Gentle Exercise
Gentle physical activity such as walking or light stretching can help improve circulation and support the lymphatic system, which helps the body remove the damaged fat cells.
##### Avoid Intense Workouts
Avoid vigorous workouts (or anything else that might cause discomfort in the treated area) for the first 24 to 48 hours after your session. After this period, you might slowly return to your usual workout routine.
##### Wear Comfortable Clothing
The areas that were treated may feel slightly sensitive or swollen. To reduce irritation, wear loosefitting, comfortable clothes in the days after your treatment.
##### Massage the Treated Area
Massaging the area that you had treated a couple of times a day for about 5 to 10 minutes can help to break down fat cells as well as keeping circulation, which will help improve your results.
##### Healthy Diet
Make sure you are eating well to complement your fat burning results. Be careful with fatty or sugary foods as might impair your progress.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How many sessions will I need?
Most patients see optimal results with 1-2 sessions per treatment area, spaced a few months apart.
### Is fat freezing painful?
The procedure is generally well-tolerated. You may feel intense cold initially, but this sensation typically subsides as the area becomes numb.
### When will I see results?
You may begin seeing results within 3 weeks, with optimal results appearing after 2-3 months as your body naturally eliminates the fat cells.
### Are there any side effects?
Common temporary side effects include redness, swelling, bruising, numbness or tingling in the treated area, which typically resolve within days or weeks.
### Is the fat reduction permanent?
Yes, the destroyed fat cells are permanently eliminated. However, maintaining a stable weight is important to prevent remaining fat cells from enlarging.
### Who is not a good candidate?
Fat freezing is not for obese individuals or those with cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.
