# Laser Hair Removal Dubai
## Long-Lasting Smooth, Hair-Free Skin
Laser hair removal is an advanced cosmetic procedure that offers long-lasting hair reduction by delivering concentrated light energy to the hair follicles. Arguably, one of the best hair removal treatment you can get is full body laser and as this procedure gets a significant edge over conventional hair-removing methods such as shaving, waxing and tweezing, the effects gained from it would get you a lifetime guarantee. Because it is non-invasive, and can be used on almost all parts of the body, it is a popular choice for both men and women who desire smooth hair-free skin.

## How Laser Hair Treatment Works
It is ideal for long term hair reduction with a targeted laser wavelength that works effectively with hair follicles. The Candela Gentle Max Pro laser is one of the most effective treatments of all, making it the best laser for hair removal on all skin types. The cooling properties of the system deliver optimum comfort, making it very popular with men and women alike looking for smooth, hair-free skin with a superior alternative to other hair removal solutions such as shaving and waxing.
## Steps in Laser Hair Removal Treatment
Laser hair removal is a procedure that uses concentrated light beams that dive into the unwanted hair and destroys its roots. The hair pigment absorbs the laser energy, which destroys the follicle's state of new hair production and then the hair growth is greatly reduced.
##### Laser Targets Hair Follicles
The laser releases light energy that is absorbed by the melanin in the hair, heating it and destroying the follicle.
##### Precision and Control
The treatment targets hair through deep penetration but leaves surrounding skin tissue unharmed.
##### Multiple Sessions Required
Because hair grows in cycles, multiple treatments are necessary to affect the follicles at various points in their growth stages.
##### Cooling Technology
Modern lasers are equipped with cooling systems to lessen pain during the procedure.
## Advantages of Laser Hair Removal
##### Why choose laser over traditional methods
One of the reasons most people choose this treatment is because of the benefits of laser hair removal. Here are some of the major benefits:
##### Long-Lasting Results
Compared to shaving or waxing prices, laser hair removal provides hair reduction, as a majority of patients report permanent hair removal after a few sessions.
##### Precision
Lasers are only effective on dark and coarse hair, which leaves the surrounding skin unharmed.
##### Quick and Efficient
Each pulse of the laser lasts a fraction of a second and can treat many hairs at once, so the treatment for large areas, such as the back or the legs, can be completed quickly.
##### Smoother Skin
Over multiple treatments, the skin will be smoother, with no ingrown hairs or stubble.
## Before Preparing for Laser Hair Removal Session
Laser treatment for hair removal is a great way to get rid of unwanted hair permanently. Specific pre-treatment instructions help ensure that the treatment works as efficiently as possible, and that you're as comfortable as possible during and after treatment.
##### Sun Protection
Stay out of the sun for two weeks beforehand.
##### Avoid Waxing/Plucking
No waxing or plucking; shaving is OK.
##### Shave Before Treatment
Do shave the area 24 hours prior to treatment.
##### Avoid Certain Products
Lay off retinoids and acids a day or two beforehand.
## Results
Laser treatment is gradual and gives visible results - you will notice less and less hair each time after each lightning session. But the results are permanent and life-changing.
##### Gradual Hair Reduction
With each session, the hair becomes thinner and more tempered until it is permanently removed.
##### Smoother, Silkier Skin
Your skin appears significantly smoother and softer, without shaving or waxing.
##### No More Ingrown Hairs
It also removes the risk of painful ingrown hairs - a common side effect of traditional hair removal tools.
##### Minimal Maintenance
Once the first series of treatments is completed, only periodic touch-ups may be needed to keep your results.

## Aftercare Tips
Laser hair removal is an excellent choice for people who want to be hair-free, but taking care of your skin afterward is extremely important to ensure it not only looks great but also gets the most benefits from the treatment.
##### Avoid Sun Exposure
Avoid direct sunlight on the treated area for at least two weeks.
##### Skip Heat Treatments
Avoid hot showers, saunas and steam rooms for at least 48 hours after treatment.
##### Use Soothing Products
You can also apply a cool compress for soothing or an aloe vera gel to wipe away any redness or discomfort on the treated area.
##### Gentle Skincare
And for a week, you should steer clear of any harsh exfoliating products or scrubs on the treated area.
