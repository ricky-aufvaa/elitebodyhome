## Q-What is a Collagen Thread Lift?
A Collagen Thread Lift is a type of non-surgical cosmetic procedure that uses dissolvable threads (usually made of collagen or polydioxanone (PDO) to lift and tighten sagging skin. These threads are placed in tissue beneath the surface of the skin and assist in stimulating the body's natural collagen generators, enhancing skin flexibility and tightness. This can give patients a refreshed appearance without undergoing more invasive surgical corporals. The threads dissolve gradually over time, but the boost of collagen helps keep those results for months.
## Process For Collagen Thread Lift Procedure
The Collagen Thread Lift procedure works by inserting dissolvable threads under the skin and lifts the sagging areas by tightening the skin. These threads are made of biocompatible materials, like polydioxanone (PDO), which dissolve on their own over time, but also induce collagen proliferation.
##### Consultation
A thorough consultation with the doctor to evaluate your skin, establish treatment goals, and describe the procedure.
##### Preparation
The area is cleaned and a topical anesthetic is applied to reduce any discomfort.
##### Thread Insertion
Collagen-stimulating threads are delicately implanted under the skin through a thin needle or cannula. These threads provide scaffolding to lift sagging skin.
##### Collagen Stimulation
The threads promote collagen production over the next period, providing natural rejuvenation of your skin and firmness.
##### Positioning & Lifting
The stitches are then delicately manipulated to elevate and smoothen the skin, sculpting better-defined contours.
##### Completion
The threads dissolve slowly, resulting in firmer, more youthful-looking skin.
## Benefits of Collagen Threads
A Collagen Thread Lift offers numerous advantages beyond simply enhanced aesthetics. This method provides many benefits compared with traditional facelift surgery and other non-surgical therapies.
##### Stimulating the Production of Collagen
The threads provide a support structure, prompting the body to stimulate its own collagen production. Increased collagen can lead to improved skin elasticity, while potentially minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
##### Lifting and Tightening
These threads can elevate sagging skin — especially in the cheeks, jawline and neck — for a more youthful appearance.
##### Natural collagen stimulation
These threads stimulate the skin to generate collagen and with time, result in enhanced skin elasticity and skin texture.
##### Customizable treatment
The procedure can be customized based upon the treatment area, i.e. the cheeks, jowls, or neck, which means a more focused lift.
##### Subtle, natural look
The results are natural and not overdone, allowing the integrity of your facial expressions to remain intact.
##### Long-lasting results
Results may last 12-18 months, but some patients may enjoy longer results due to increased collagen production.
## Who is a Candidate for Collagen Thread Lift?
This type is great for mild to moderate levels of skin laxity and non-surgical appearance care. The average age of candidates is between 30 and 60 but can vary depending on the person's skin condition.
##### Mild sagging
Those with mild sagging or drooping skin, such as in the face, jawline and neck.
##### Non-surgical option
Those not ready for invasive surgery with facelifts.
##### Quick recovery
People who want to get back fast and with little downtime.
## What You Can Expect Before a Collagen Thread Lift
Prepping For A Collagen Thread Lift: The Essential Guide Your practitioner will provide full instructions prior to your procedure.
##### Avoid certain medications
All common blood thinners — like aspirin — and supplements that can increase bruising should be discontinued.
##### Limit alcohol and smoking
Treat yourself right by avoiding alcohol and smoking 24 hours prior to your treatment to help the healing process.
##### Stay hydrated
Be well-hydrated in the days before your procedure, as this helps with skin elasticity and healing.
##### Discuss your medical history
Be sure to inform your practitioner of any health issues or medications in advance.
## Results
A Collagen Thread Lift has both immediate and long-term outcomes. Immediately after the procedure, clients will notice a lift and tightening in the treated areas. The effects become even more primal in the following weeks, as the skin naturally generates more collagen resulting in a renewed, youthful glow.

### How long do the results last?
Results from a Collagen Thread Lift can last between 12-18 months, depending on factors such as age, lifestyle, and skin type. Since the threads stimulate collagen production, the skin continues to improve even after the threads dissolve.
