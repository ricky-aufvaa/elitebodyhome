## What is PRP Hair Treatment?
PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) hair treatment is a non-surgical procedure that can be used to promote the growth of hair and enhance the health of hair. It entails taking a small volume of the patient's own blood, purifying it in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting this platelet-rich plasma into the scalp at sites of hair thinning or hair loss.
## PRP Treatment Procedure
PRP hair therapy is a succinct procedure that delves deep into hair follicles, making it more efficient.
##### Blood Draw
Blood is drawn from the patient's arm for a small amount.
##### Centrifugation
The blood is sent to a centrifuge, to separate the platelet-rich plasma.
##### PRP Injection
Through small, fine needles, this PRP is injected into the targeted areas of the scalp. Injection sites will generally target thinning or bald patches.
##### Recovery
The whole procedure lasts a few minutes and little recovery time is needed so that the patients can get on with their daily lives immediately after the procedure.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Is PRP FDA Approved?
The FDA has approved the devices and equipment used to prepare PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), ensuring they meet safety standards for handling blood products. However, PRP itself is not specifically FDA-approved for hair restoration or aesthetic applications, as it's considered an off-label treatment in these areas. At Elite Body Home, we adhere to high standards of care and use FDA-cleared equipment to ensure your PRP treatment is conducted safely and effectively.
### How Many Sessions for PRP Treatment?
Typically, patients undergo 3-4 sessions spaced about 4-6 weeks apart. Maintenance sessions may be required every 4-6 months to sustain results.
### Do PRP Injections Hurt?
At Elite Body Home, we strive to make PRP treatments as comfortable as possible. PRP injections involve minimal discomfort, as we use fine needles to administer the plasma into targeted areas. To enhance your comfort, we may also apply a numbing cream to the treatment area before starting. While individual pain tolerance varies, most clients report feeling only slight pressure or a mild pinch. Our experienced professionals prioritize your comfort and are always available to discuss any concerns you may have.
### Are There Any Side Effects?
Because PRP uses your own blood, side effects are minimal. Some patients may experience mild swelling, bruising, or tenderness at the injection site, which usually resolves within a few days.
### How Soon Can I See Results?
Most patients begin to see visible improvement in hair density within 3-6 months after the initial treatment. However, results may vary based on individual factors like age, the extent of hair loss, and response to treatment.
### Is PRP Effective for All Types of Hair Loss?
PRP is most effective for androgenic alopecia and thinning hair. It may not be as successful for individuals with complete baldness or advanced hair loss stages.
