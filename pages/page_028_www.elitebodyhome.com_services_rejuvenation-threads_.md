# Rejuvenation Threads
## Revive Your Glow, Redefine Your Youth
Rejuvenation Threads, also referred to as thread lifts, are a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure used for the lifting and tightening of sagging skin to create a more youthful and rejuvenated appearance. This procedure is a favorite among those seeking a non-invasive facelift solution.

## How Do Rejuvenation Threads Work?
Rejuvenation threads are special dissolvable threads made from biocompatible materials such as polydioxanone (PDO), poly-L-lactic acid (PLA), or polycaprolactone (PCA). These threads are placed beneath the skin with fine needles for a lifting effect. They eventually dissolve but not before prompting the body's natural healing response, which then increases the production of collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid for skin-tightening results that last.
##### Consultation
To evaluate your skin and determine the areas to be improved, you need to consult with a specialist in detail.
##### Thread Insertion
Local anesthesia is used, and fine threads are meticulously introduced with a very thin needle in order to give the targeted areas an upward and firming effect.
##### Adjustment
The threads are subsequently tweaked to give an immediate lift. The positioning is meant to shape the face while easing sagging and wrinkles.
##### Recovery
Because the process is non-surgical, recovery is also minimal, and the average patient can return to normal daily activity immediately afterward.
## Benefits
##### Advantages of Rejuvenation Threads
Rejuvenation threads have gained popularity among those seeking to enhance their physical appearance without resorting to surgery, and with good reason.
##### Non-surgical
No cuts, sutures or general anesthesia needed.
##### Minimal Downtime
Patients generally go back to their usual activities within a day or two.
##### Immediate Results
Lifting and tightening effects are seen immediately after the procedure, with improvements continuing for several months as collagen production ramps up.
##### Natural-Looking Outcome
The gradual collagen stimulation will make your face look fresh, but still, natural.
##### Longevity
Results may last 12-24 months depending on thread type and individual skin condition.
##### Versatile Treatment Areas
It could be performed on different regions of the body like the face, neck, jawline, even body.
## Eligibility
Rejuvenation Threads can benefit a lot of adults, but there are some criteria that would make you the perfect candidate for this procedure.
##### Mild to Moderate Skin Laxity
Best candidates are those who have early signs of aging like sagging skin or jowls.
##### Healthy Skin
For best results, you want to have relatively healthy skin without extreme damage or heavy sagging.
##### Age Group
Thread lifts are most commonly used on patients aged 30 to 60.
##### No Allergic Reactions
Candidates should not be allergic to any of the materials used in the threads.
## Preparation
The procedure of rejuvenation threads requires proper preparation to make this process as successful and efficient as possible.
##### Consultation
Undergo comprehensive consultation where your medical history, your goals as well as the risks are discussed in detail.
##### Avoid Anti-Inflammatories
Avoid anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or aspirin for at least one week before the procedure because they can promote bruising.
##### Stop Smoking
If you smoke, you will have to quit at least two weeks before and after the treatment to aid the healing process.
##### Skin Care
In the days leading up to the procedure, avoid aggressive exfoliating treatments or peels to minimize irritation.
## Results
Rejuvenation threads provide noticeably visible results immediately, with heightened effects developing in the weeks and months that follow as the body begins to produce collagen. Your skin should appear smoother, tighter, and lifted and naturally, more youthful.
##### Immediate Lifting
Immediate visible tightening of skin laxity post surgery
##### Progressive Enhancement
If you smoke, you'll have to quit two weeks before and after the treatment as well, to aid in the healing process.
##### Long-Lasting Results
Results from rejuvenation threads can last from 12 to 24 months, depending on the material used and individual lifestyle factors.
