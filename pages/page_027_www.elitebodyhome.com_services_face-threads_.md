## What are Face Threads?
Face threads, also called thread lifts, are a non-surgical cosmetic treatment that helps to lift up and tighten sagging skin on the face and neck. It uses a biocompatible and absorbable thread placed into the skin that provides support as well as assists with collagen generation. These threads ask the skin tissue to reposition, for a fresher and more youthful appearance.
## The Face Threads Procedure
This absolute insider info is about the face threads procedure – and what to expect before, during and after this treatment. Face threads are done under the care of a qualified healthcare professional or aesthetician, and the entire process typically takes around 30 to 60 minutes, depending on how many areas are being treated. It is generally minimal pain and downtime.
##### Consultation
The first step is a pre-treatment consultation to identify your goals and to evaluate the areas of concern. Your practitioner will identify the areas that need a lift.
##### Anesthesia
Or numbing cream is applied to keep patients comfortable throughout the surgery.
##### Thread Insertion
The strings are inserted into the subdermal layers of the skin in accordance with the pre-established pattern, utilizing a thin needle or cannula. The threads hold the sagging tissue and the lifting effect happened when the threads are tightened.
##### Adjustment and Finish
The practitioner then repositions the threads under the skin to achieve the desired amount of lift and symmetry. Trim the threads, and that is all there is to it.
##### Post-Procedure Care
You might develop slight swelling or bruising after the treatment, but this usually subsides within a few days. Most patients carried on with their daily lives the same day or soon after.
## Benefits
That is why face threads are getting increasingly popular as a cosmetic procedure among people who want to refresh their look, but are not so keen on invasive surgical procedures.
##### Immediate Lifting Effect
Face threads offer an overview lifting effect, to lift flaccidity and wrinkles and improve the shape of the facial contour.
##### Collagen Stimulation
The threads also help stimulate collagen production in the skin, leading to skin that is long-term firm and supple.
##### Minimally Invasive
Being a non-invasive procedure, face threads allow patients to get back to their routine with limited downtime and a risk of complications way lower than a typical facelift.
##### Natural-Looking Results
Face threads produce more subtle, natural-type changes, so it's an excellent option for anyone who prefers a more low-key change.
##### Versatility
The treatment can be done by targeting specific areas of concern; for example, the jawline, cheeks, neck, and brows, making it efficient.
##### Long-Lasting Results
As the threads dissolve within, collagen building is a gradual process, and results can last 12-18 months.
## Eligibility
Facial threads are not suitable for everybody. First, you'll want to determine if you qualify for this procedure.
##### Age Range
Face threads are generally advised for ages 30-65, and those who have mild to moderate skin laxity.
##### Skin Concerns
Ideal candidates have early signs of sagging around the jawline, cheeks, neck, or forehead. People with worse sagging might need a surgical facelift.
##### Good Health
Candidates must be in good overall health, free from active infections or chronic skin problems in the area of treatment.
## Preparation
The right preparation is also the best way to provide for as good results as possible and reduce possible harms.
##### Avoid Blood Thinners
Stop blood-thinning medications (like aspirin or ibuprofen) for at least a week before the procedure to help minimize bruising.
##### Stop Smoking and Alcohol
Refrain from smoking and drinking alcohol for at least 48 hours before the procedure, since both can impact the healing process.
##### Hydrate
Drinking adequate water and a healthy diet can help your body to heal faster and produce collagen.
##### Plan for Downtime
Though there's little downtime with the procedure, some mild swelling or bruising may occur, so allow for a few days of rest.
## Results
Face threads provide both immediate and long-term benefits, making them a popular option for facial rejuvenation.
##### Immediate Lift
You will experience a slight lifting effect right after the treatment, followed by gradual improvement in collagen production over the next few weeks.
##### Natural Look
The results are natural and understated, enhancing your facial contours without making you look 'overdone.'
##### Long-Term Benefits
When the threads dissolve, the firmness and texture of your skin will continue to improve owing to new collagen production.
