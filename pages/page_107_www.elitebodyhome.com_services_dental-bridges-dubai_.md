## Dental Bridge Treatment Procedure in Steps
The process of getting a dental bridge is simple, usually requiring two to three visits to your dentist. Dental bridges work by securing the false tooth (or teeth) (called pontics) to adjacent natural teeth or to dental implants.
## Here's a rundown of the process:
##### Initial Consultation
Your dentist will examine your oral health and determine whether you are a good candidate for a bridge. You might also get X-rays to check the area around the tooth and jawbone.
##### Preparation of Adjacent Teeth
Abutment teeth are prepared by reshaping the adjacent teeth to make room for crowns that are used to support the bridge.
##### Impression of Your Teeth
A mold of your teeth will be used to create a customized fit for the bridge. Based on your needs, the dentist will choose the right material for your dental crown, which may be porcelain, ceramic, or metal.
##### Temporary Bridge Placement
A temporary bridge: A temporary bridge is placed over the prepared teeth while the permanent bridge is being fabricated in a dental lab.
##### Fitting the Permanent Bridge
When the permanent bridge is finished it is tested for fit, adjusted if it so happens, and then firmly cemented in place.
##### Final Adjustments & Follow-Up
The dentist or oral surgery will confirm that the bridge is correctly positioned, making any necessary adjustments for comfort and function. A follow-up visit is usually booked to check progress.
## Benefits
##### There are many benefits of All-on-4 dental bridges besides the pure aesthetic that they provide that goes far deeper than your smile.
Dental implants are the right technology for altering life for the good.
##### Restores Chewing Function
If you are missing teeth, it can be hard and unpleasant to eat. With a dental bridge, you can chew fully as before and enjoy your favorite foods free of pain.
##### Prevents Teeth from Shifting
The gaps created from lost teeth can allow surrounding teeth to drift out of position, resulting in bite issues or jaw pain. Dental bridges help to keep your teeth in alignment.
##### Improves Speech
Losing teeth — particularly in the front of the mouth — can impair speech. Bridges fill in those gaps and help you with the right pronunciation of words.
##### Boosts Self-Confidence
Missing teeth may affect your smile and self-esteem. Providing a natural smile and confidence to interact without worry, dental bridges replace missing teeth.
## Eligibility
##### For many people who have lost one, two, or several teeth, dental bridges can be a terrific solution.
But not everyone is a candidate for that treatment. Here's who is eligible:
##### Good Oral Health
Your remaining teeth and gums must be healthy and disease free to support a bridge.
##### Adequate Bone Structure
The technical aspects must be strong enough to support the bridge and sufficient jawbone needs to be present to anchor the teeth properly.
##### Missing Teeth — One or Multiple
Dental bridges are typically the right choice for people who have lost one or more adjacent teeth — not an entire arch of teeth.
##### Non-Smokers
Smoking may impact the healing and long-term success of a dental bridge.
## Preparation
##### Some preparation is needed before the dental bridge process begins.
By following these steps, you can ensure that your procedure goes smoothly and your dental bridge lasts longer.
##### Maintain Good Oral Hygiene
Regularly brush and floss to keep your gums and adjacent teeth healthy.
##### Address Pre-Existing Conditions
In most cases, any dental problems, such as gum disease or tooth decay, will have to be addressed before the bridge can be placed.
##### Discuss Material Options
Depending on your preference and budget, talk to your dentist about what is ideal for your dental bridge, and whether porcelain, ceramic, or metal materials are the best match.
##### Take Pain Medication (if prescribed)
You might need over-the-counter pain relief or medication prescribed by your dentist in the days after the procedure to help with any discomfort.
## Results
##### Ultimately, the effects of receiving a dental bridge are both immediate & long-lasting.
Post-treatment, patients typically demonstrate both enhanced functionality and improved aesthetics, in addition to better oral health.
##### Regained Chewing & Speaking Function
Replacement teeth are securely placed in the mouth, and patients can chew food and speak without concerns over clarity, immediately after the bridge is affiliated.
##### Enhanced Aesthetic Appearance
It restores the aesthetics of your smile by filling in the gaps and can also enhance overall facial structure, helping you feel more confident in your appearance.
##### Prevention of Teeth Shifting
Bridges prevent adjacent teeth from moving into the empty space, preserving proper tooth alignment and helping to avoid future dental issues.
##### The Long-Term Oral Health Benefits
When taken care of, dental bridges can help prevent bone loss, alleviate stress on nearby teeth and maintain your bite's architecture, all of which prevent ongoing oral health issues in the future.
