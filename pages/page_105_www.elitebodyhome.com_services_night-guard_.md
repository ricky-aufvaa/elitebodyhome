## What is a Night Guard?
Your night guard is a dental device that fits over your teeth and should be worn while sleeping for protection against the effects of grinding or clenching your teeth. It provides a buffer, absorbing the pressure and preventing the upper and lower teeth from touching directly.
## Steps For Dental Night Guard Procedure
Key Points:
##### Indication
It prevents bruxism damage to teeth.
##### Custom fit
Designed to fit your mouth perfectly for optimal comfort and protection.
##### Material
From soft up to hard acrylic depending on how much you grind.
## Benefits
There are many benefits to wearing a night guard which extend well beyond teeth protection.
##### Prevents Tooth Damage
Night guards protect your teeth from the grinding forces that can wear down enamel, chip teeth or cause cracks.
##### Reduces Jaw Pain
Night guards alleviate jaw muscle tension caused by excessive clenching that may exacerbate a TMJ disorder.
##### Improves Sleep Quality
Night guards can help relax your jaw, which makes falling asleep and staying asleep at night easier.
##### Cost-Effective
The cost of a night guard is less expensive than a crown, veneer, or implant needed to repair damaged teeth.
## Eligibility
Your dentist can assess if you are a good candidate for a night guard after a thorough evaluation of your symptoms and dental history.
##### Teeth Grinders (Bruxism)
If you grind or clench your teeth regularly, you may develop enough wear and tear on your enamel to require a night guard.
##### Patients with TMJ Disorders
Those who experience pain in their jaw, or a popping or clicking sound may benefit from a night guard.
##### People with Grinding Induced by Stress
Night guards can protect your teeth if you tend toward stress, which is a classic trigger for bruxism.
##### Individuals with Dental Restorations
A night guard can help protect dental restorations from wear and tear caused by grinding.
## Preparation
Preparation for your night guard appointment guarantees an experience with you in mind from start to finish.
##### Talk to your dentist about the signs
Discuss any symptoms you may have, such as jaw pain, tooth sensitivity or headaches.
##### Thoroughly Clean Teeth Prior to Impressions
Brush your teeth when the dental impressions are made so that your teeth are molded correctly.
##### Bring a List of Medications
Some medications can affect your oral health, so you need to give your dentist a current medication list.
##### Ask Questions
Ask your dentist any questions related to the process, including how to care for your night guard.
## Results
Most people notice the benefits of night guard wear within a few days of usage.
##### Reduced Jaw Pain & Discomfort
A night guard helps ease tension in the jaw, relieving pain and discomfort from teeth grinding and clenching.
##### Protection from Tooth Damage
Night guards help keep your teeth safe from enamel wearing down, cracking, and breaking.
##### Improved Sleep Quality
A night guard helps you sleep more soundly and without interruptions because it decreases muscle tension in the jaw.
##### Avoiding Expensive Dental Treatments
Regular use prevents teeth and dental work from becoming damaged, saving the patient from costly restorative work.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How do I know if I need a night guard?
