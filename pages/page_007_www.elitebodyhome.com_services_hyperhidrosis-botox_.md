# Hyperhidrosis Botox Treatment in Dubai
What is Hyperhidrosis Botox Treatment? Botox for hyperhidrosis involves using Botulinum toxin to block the nerves that cause excessive sweating. The procedure targets areas like the underarms, hands, feet, and face, where overactive sweat glands are causing discomfort.

## Key Points:
Minimally invasive: Botox injections are a non-surgical solution to excessive sweating. Long-lasting effects: Results can last for several months, making it a preferred choice for many. FDA-approved: Botox is an approved and safe treatment option for primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating).
## Steps For Hyperhidrosis Treatment Procedure
The Botox therapy for hyperhidrosis is a simple and somewhat short procedure. When carried out by a qualified medical practitioner, the process guarantees that particular regions that are prone to excessive perspiration are adequately addressed.
##### Consultation
In order to evaluate the afflicted areas and make sure Botox is the best course of action for the patient, a consultation is held prior to the procedure.
##### Identifying the Region
The locations that will receive injections will be marked by the practitioner.
##### Injections
In the regions with overactive sweat glands, Botox is injected just beneath the skin using a tiny needle.
##### Marking the Area
The practitioner will mark the areas where injections will be administered.
##### Aftercare
Patients can resume normal activities immediately after the treatment, with minimal restrictions.
## Benefits of Hyperhidrosis Botox
Hyperhidrosis Botox offers a number of benefits, allowing individuals to regain confidence and comfort in their everyday lives. It is a trusted and efficient solution for those suffering from excessive sweating, particularly in areas like the underarms, palms, and soles of the feet.
##### Efficient management of perspiration
Depending on the area treated, Botox can reduce perspiration by as much as 82–87%.
##### Minimally invasive and rapid
Botox is a non-surgical procedure that offers relief with little to no downtime.
##### Durable outcomes
Most patients enjoy dryness for 6 to 12 months, reducing the need for daily antiperspirants or special treatments.
##### Enhanced self-assurance
Following therapy, patients frequently report feeling less self-conscious and more confident.
## Eligibility
Not everyone who sweats excessively has hyperhidrosis, and not everyone with hyperhidrosis is a candidate for Botox treatment. It’s important to undergo a thorough consultation to determine if Botox is the right treatment for you.
##### Individuals with Excessive Sweating
People who experience abnormal sweating (hyperhidrosis) that affects their daily activities, particularly in the underarms, hands, feet, or face.
##### Patients Unresponsive to Other Treatments
Those who have tried other forms of treatment such as prescription antiperspirants, oral medications, or other topical treatments but haven’t seen significant improvement.
##### Medically Cleared Candidates
Patients who are in good overall health, with no history of neuromuscular diseases or allergies to botulinum toxin.
##### People Seeking a Non-Surgical Solution
Individuals looking for a minimally invasive option to manage excessive sweating without the need for surgical intervention.
##### Candidates Looking for Long-Lasting Results
Those seeking temporary relief from hyperhidrosis, typically lasting 4 to 6 months with regular Botox injections.
## Preparation
Preparing for Hyperhidrosis Botox treatment involves a few important steps to ensure the best possible outcome. Following the right pre-procedure guidelines will help the treatment be more effective and reduce the likelihood of side effects.
##### Do not shave the treated area
Do not shave the armpits for a minimum of 24 hours prior to the treatment.
##### Avoid antiperspirants and deodorants
Do not wear deodorants/antiperspirants on the day of treatment.
##### Talk to your doctor about drugs
Some medications (including blood thinners) can heighten the likelihood of bruising, so be sure to check in with your doctor if you’re on any medications.
##### Wear loose clothing
It is recommended that you wear loose, comfortable clothing the day of the procedure, so there is no irritation after the treatment.
## Results
Hyperhidrosis Botox provides lasting, dramatic relief for people who are suffering from excessive sweating. Surely that was not only a physical result, but the emotional change to that person’s life as a whole could change completely for the better.
##### Reduced sweating
You can expect a significant decrease in sweating in the treated areas (for 6-12 months).
##### Quick onset of results
A lot of the patients see a decrease in their perspiration already in 2-4 days after being treated.
##### Improved quality of life
Less sweating means less self-consciousness, which results in more social confidence, at work and at play.
##### Minimal side effects
Although some degree of redness or bruising is possible, it is generally temporary and minimal.
