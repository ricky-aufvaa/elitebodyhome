## Procedure
The Hair Generate IV Drip treatment involves administering a customized blend of essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients directly into your bloodstream via intravenous infusion. This allows for maximum absorption and effectiveness, targeting deficiencies that may contribute to hair loss or thinning.
##### Consultation
A consultation with a qualified medical professional is conducted to assess hair health and discuss any specific concerns or goals.
##### Preparation
The patient is seated comfortably in a treatment chair, and their medical history is reviewed. Vital signs may be checked to ensure they are fit for the IV drip.
##### IV Insertion
A sterile IV catheter is gently inserted into a vein, typically in the arm. The insertion site is cleaned with an antiseptic solution to avoid infection.
##### Infusion of Nutrients
The Hair Generate IV drip delivers essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids to promote hair growth and strength in a 30-60 minute session.
##### Monitoring
During the drip, the patient is monitored by medical staff to ensure comfort and proper administration of the nutrients. Any discomfort or concerns should be immediately addressed by the staff.
##### Completion
Once the infusion is complete, the IV is removed, and a small bandage is applied to the insertion site. Post-care advice is given, including hydration tips and follow-up recommendations for future sessions.
