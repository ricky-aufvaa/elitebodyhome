# Nasolabial Fold Filler in Dubai
## Say Goodbye to Deep Smile Lines
Nasolabial folds, commonly known as the "smile lines" or the "laugh lines," are the deep creases that run between the sides of your nose and the corners of your mouth. With time, these lines may become deeper due to the aging of the skin and sun exposure, along with a loss of collagen. If you want to smooth out these folds and restore your youthful look, Nasolabial Fold Fillers are a quick and effective procedure.

## What Are Fillers for Nasolabial Folds?
Nasolabial fold fillers are injectable treatments aimed at restoring volume and smoothing deep lines around the nose and mouth. These fillers are composed of hyaluronic acid, a substance that is naturally found within the body, adding hydration and plumping to the skin. Elite Body Home uses the highest quality fillers: Juvederm, Restylane, and other FDA approved brands to ensure the best and longest lasting results.
## Nasolabial Fold Filler Procedure Steps
##### Consultation
To assess the best filler and treatment plan for you, the specialist will evaluate your nasolabial folds, skin condition, and facial structure during the consultation.
##### Preparation
This helps to ensure the area around the nasolabial folds is clean and prevents any infection. You will then have a topical numbing cream applied to the area to eliminate any discomfort during surgery.
##### Injections
This will allow the practitioner to mark the areas that need to be injected with filler.
##### Massage & Shaping
The practitioner may also gently massage the injection site after the procedure to help disperse the filler evenly and ensure that it camouflages smoothly into your natural facial structure.
##### Filler Injections
The dermal filler is carefully injected into the areas marked on the nasolabial folds using a fine needle or cannula.
##### Final Assessment
As soon as the filler is added, the professional will evaluate the results and add a touch if needed. You will be provided with post-treatment directives to achieve proper healing for the best possible outcome.
## What Are The Advantages Of Nasolabial Fold Filler Treatment
My nasolabial fold filler came home at a lower cost, and the benefits went beyond just lines being filled. This treatment offers a refreshed, more youthful appearance with little recovery time.
##### Immediate Results
See a visible reduction in smile lines immediately following your treatment.
##### Minimally Invasive
The entire procedure is non-invasive, with no incisions or surgery, and minimum downtime.
##### Natural, Youthful Look
Fillers offer subtle, natural-looking augmentations that give facial volumization without making you look overdone!
##### Customizable to Your Needs
This allows for more precise contouring, as well as individualized placement of filler and injectables to complement your specific facial structure and desires.
##### Quick Procedure
Treatment is usually finished in less than 30 minutes, to suit busy lifestyles.
##### Long-Lasting Effects
Depending on the filler, results can range from six to 18 months for long-lasting rejuvenation.
## Eligibility
Although fillers for nasolabial folds are safe for most people, you should make sure you're a good candidate.
##### Patients with moderate to severe nasolabial folds
If the lines around your mouth and nose are something that are causing you concern, this treatment may be for you.
##### Healthy Adults
Patients must be in good overall health, without conditions that could impede healing.
##### Current non-smokers or people who are willing to quit smoking
Smoking can also hinder healing of the treatment area.
##### Realistic expectations
Patients should understand that fillers — while impressive — are not limitless and they're temporary.
##### Non-pregnant and non-breastfeeding individuals
One big reason dermal fillers should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding is the absence of safety data on their use during these periods.
## Preparation
By preparing properly for treatment with nasolabial fold filler, patients can achieve the best-possible results with as few complications as possible.
##### Avoid blood thinners
Avoid taking aspirin, ibuprofen or other blood-thinning drugs for at least a week before the procedure, to minimize bruising.
##### Consult your doctor
This can include allergies, medications, or past cosmetic procedures.
##### No alcohol or smoking
Refrain from alcohol for 24 hours before your appointment and reduce or eliminate smoking, which can prompt increased bruising and slowed healing.
##### Hydrate
In the days before your appointment, drink lots of water, because hydrated skin heals better and allows for more optimal results.
##### Clean skin
Show up with your skin clean and makeup-free to reduce your risk of infection.
## Results
This is because nasolabial fold fillers provide really dramatic results that are very gratifying for the patient. The filler is used to fill the lines itself and the volume that comes in, will shorten the depth of the lines as a result giving you a fresher and scrawnier look.
##### Immediate Improvement
You'll see a decrease in the depth of nasolabial folds immediately after the treatment.
##### Optimal Results
Full results are seen in about a week, after any swelling or bruising resolves.
##### Temporary Results
Results generally last anywhere from 6 to 18 months, depending upon the type of filler, and you can opt for follow-up treatments as needed to keep you looking the way you want.
##### Minimal Downtime
You can return to normal life straight away as there is only minimal aftercare required post-treatment.

## Duties to be performed after Nasolabial Fold Filler Treatment
Follow these top aftercare tips for optimal results and a smooth recovery after your nasolabial fold filler treatment:
##### Avoid Touching the Area
Do not touch, massage, or apply pressure to the treated area for at least 24 hours.
##### Minimize Physical Activity
Do not do strenuous activities, such as exercise for 24 to 48 hours after the treatment to minimize your risk of swelling or bruising.
##### Stay Hydrated
Drink lots of water to keep your skin hydrated and even help the filler settle more naturally in the skin.
##### Avoid Heat Exposure
Avoid saunas, steam rooms, and too much sun for a few days, as heat can exacerbate swelling and irritation.
##### Use Cold Compresses
If you have slight swelling or bruising, which is normal, gently hold a cold wrap over the area for 10-15 minutes to ease inflammation.
##### Sleep with a Pillow Under the Chest
For the first night or two, sleep with your head slightly elevated to reduce swelling and to prevent any movement of the filler.
##### Do Not Consume Alcohol and Blood Thinners
Avoid alcohol and blood thinners such as aspirin for at least 24 hours after the procedure to minimize bruising.
