## What is PRP Facial Treatment?
PRP (platelet pin-rich plasma) facial treatment, popularly known as the 'vampire facial,' involves drawing a small amount of your blood, preparing it to extract as many platelets as possible by separating them from the red blood cells, and injecting or applying the plasma to the skin directly. Platelets, which are abundant in growth factors, promote the synthesis of collagen and cell renewal, resulting in skin that is smoother, firmer, and more youthful in appearance.
## Important Note: PRP Facial Treatment Process
##### Natural skin rejuvenation
Heals with and improves the texture of skin with own blood
##### Non-surgical
A less-invasive, non-surgical version of facelifts and fillers.
##### Boosts collagen production
Aids in reducing fine lines, wrinkles, and aging.
##### Quick recovery time
Little recovery time compared to other oral and facial cosmetic procedures.
## Advantages of PRP Treatment for Face
PRP facial treatments provide a range of advantages for individuals looking to naturally enhance the appearance of their skin. By harnessing the body's own healing capabilities, PRP provides a long-lasting, youthful glow, with minimal risk and side effects.
##### Improves Skin Texture & Tone
Targets uneven skin tone, fine lines and dullness.
##### Reduces Wrinkles
Stimulates collagen production — smoothing out & helping reduce fine lines & deeper wrinkles.
##### Minimizes Acne Scars
Assists in mending damaged skin and diminishing pitted scars.
##### Boosts Hydration
PRP improves moisture retention that gives skin more plump and healthy look.
##### Enhances Skin Elasticity
Its tightening, firming effect strengthens the skin structure for a firmer, tighter skin.
##### Safe & Natural
As it incorporates your own plasma, it carries little risk of allergic reactions or complications.
## PRP Facial Treatment: Who is Right for It?
The ideal candidate for PRP treatment of the face would be someone who desires a natural, non-surgical solution to rejuvenate their skin. But, as with any cosmetic procedure, eligibility is based on certain criteria.
##### Adult Applications for Facial Rejuvenation
Well-suited for mild to moderate skin aging concerns.
##### Non-Smokers
Smoking can inhibit healing and diminish the benefits of the treatment.
##### People with Good Overall Health
Those who do not have serious health issues, including blood disorders or infections.
##### Not Pregnant or Breastfeeding
PRP treatment is typically not advised in the duration of pregnancy or breastfeeding.
## Before PRP Facial Treatment: How to Prepare
PRP facial treatments produce the best results only if you've taken care beforehand. Adhering to certain protocols prior to your appointment will help maximize the procedure's results and reduce its risks.
##### Do not take blood-thinning medications
Do not take aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs for several days before, unless your doctor instructs you to.
##### Stay Hydrated
Make sure to hydrate well up to your treatment.
##### Avoid Sun Exposure
Minimize sun exposure and skip tanning beds one week prior to your session.
##### Stop Using Skincare Products
Refrain from using retinoids, acids or exfoliating products a few days before the treatment.
## Results
The recovery period after PRP facial treatments is usually rapid with little downtime. Patients can typically go back to their daily routines right away, but some aftercare is needed for best results.
##### Immediate Effects
Minimal inflammation, erythema and tautness of the-treated area resolves in 1-3 days.
##### Gradual Results
Visible skin improvements occur over a period of weeks as collagen production is stimulated.
##### Long-lasting Rejuvenation
Results can be long-lasting – up to 12 months – depending on individual skin type, lifestyle and skin care routine.
