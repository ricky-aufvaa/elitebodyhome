# PDO Thread Lift
## Lift & Rejuvenate Naturally with PDO Threads!
The PDO Thread Lift is an advanced, non-surgical treatment used to lift and tighten sagging skin, restoring a youthful visage without the need for invasive surgery. This consists of the insertion of polydioxanone (PDO) threads (which dissolve) to instantaneously lift and contour the face, neck, and the rest of the body. It has become appreciated for its ability to create natural-looking results with little downtime.

## What is a PDO Thread Lift?
Threads are made of polydioxanone, which has been used in surgery for many years. The sutures are inserted beneath the skin using very thin needles, and the sutures dissolve over time naturally, promoting collagen synthesis and providing better skin texture, elasticity and firmness. Unlike traditional facelifts, a PDO Thread Lift can be performed without large incisions or extensive recovery time. The threads raise droopy spots, smooth out wrinkles and provide the face with a fresher look.
## PDO thread lift process Procedure for PDO Thread Lift
What Is The PDO Thread Lift Treatment? A PDO Thread Lift is a fast and non-invasive procedure that can be done in the office under local anesthesia. Here's a step-by-step rundown of how the process generally goes:
##### Consultation
An extensive consultation takes place to evaluate the areas needing treatment and to ensure the patient's desired outcomes are in line with PDO Thread Lift expectations.
##### Anesthesia
Once you are comfortable, local anesthesia is injected to eliminate any pain throughout the surgery.
##### Insertion of Threads
PDO threads are introduced into the subdermal layer of the skin with the help of an ultra-fine needle in the targeted areas.
##### Lifting and Contouring
The threads are strategically adjusted to hold up drooping skin and reshape the face. It can be carefully placed in the cheeks, jawline, neck, or brow area.
## Benefits of PDO Thread Lift
##### PDO Thread Lift Benefits
PDO thread lift is a non-surgical method to lift and tighten the skin. The primary benefit is its ability to deliver natural, subtle results without the need for invasive surgery.
##### Minimally Invasive
No large incisions or stitches are needed — just a simple, minimally invasive and relatively painless procedure.
##### Natural Results
The threads dissolve within a few months, and the skin is firmer due to collagen stimulation.
##### Immediate Improvement
You will notice some lifting and tightening right after the procedure.
##### Short Recovery Time
Most patients resume routine activities within several days.
##### Versatile Treatment Areas
PDO threads can be applied to a wide range of areas, including the face, neck, décolletage, and even the knees or abdomen depending on where you want a lift.
##### Collagen Stimulation
With PDO threads, collagen is produced while the threads dissolve, resulting in better skin texture and elasticity.
## Am I a Good Candidate for PDO Thread Lift?
The PDO Thread Lift provides a perfect solution for those wanting moderate lifting of their skin without having to go under the knife. However, it's not right for everyone.
##### Mild to Moderate Skin Laxity
It's best for those who have early sagging in areas such as your cheeks, jowls, neck or brow.
##### Good Skin Elasticity
Patient must have reasonably good skin health.
##### Realistic Expectations
Candidates should know that this is a non-surgical procedure, and thus the results may not be as dramatic as those of a full facelift.
##### No Significant Medical Conditions
PDO Thread Lifts are not recommended for those with autoimmune conditions and a history of poor wound healing.
## What To Do To Prepare For A PDO Thread Lift
Pre-op is very important in getting good results and an uneventful recovery. Your physician will give you individualized instructions for your PDO Thread Lift.
##### Medications that Thin the Blood
Avoid aspirin, ibuprofen and other blood-thinning medications for at least a week before the procedure to lessen the chance of bruising.
##### Limit Alcohol Consumption
Do not consume alcohol for 48 hours prior to your appointment, as this can increase the risk of bruising and swelling.
##### Hydrate
Be sure to drink plenty of fluids in the days before the procedure.
##### Plan for Downtime
Since recovery is minimal, most people will experience swelling or bruising, so plan to take it easy for 24–48 hours after the treatment.
## Outcome & PDO Thread Lift Aftercare
Most patients will notice instant improvements after a PDO Thread Lift procedure, with results continuing to develop over the next couple of months as the collagen builds. Then, you need to follow aftercare instructions to the letter to prolong the life of your results.
